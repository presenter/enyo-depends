#Enyo Editor

An Enyo kind that provides a simple interface for creating components for presentations, used in the Presenter Creator. 

###Dependencies

If you're using the Presenter Enyo Dependency Manager, simply run `enyo-depends install presenter/enyo-editor` in your application folder. This will automatically resolve all dependencies and add the editor into your main package.js.

You may also manage dependencies yourself. The editor requires font-awesome (for the editor icons) and Onyx (for the UI).

There's currently a hanging dependency for jQuery, but that will be removed very soon.
